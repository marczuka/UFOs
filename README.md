# UFOs
Working on data visualization and dynamic filtering a web-page using JavaScript.

This project contains <b><i>index.html</b></i> designed using Bootstrap and Java Script. The page visualizes UFO sightings data 
from <b><i>data.js</b></i> file using JavaScript and D3 library. <b><i>App.js</b></i> adds one filter - date - to the table. This filter is activated using [Filter Table] button (reduced in the futher version of the app).

## Challenge
<b><i>Challenge.js</b></i> allows to dynamically filter UFO sightings table by different parameters - date, city, state, country and 
shape - and the filter is applyed to the table upon the change made to one of the input fields (so no need in the [Filter Table] button
anymore).

For further development, I would recommend to add error-handling functionality that would let user know if data they provided make no
sense or is provided in a wrong format. 
It would be also interesting to display tooltips about specific input fields when user places a cursor over a specific filter element.
